If you’re named Mark, you may have a head start as a marketeer. Not that Mark de Kock needs one. As an independent, motivated leader, he will go from 0 to 150 mph faster than you can imagine. He knows that making sense of this fragmented digital world can be a tough road to navigate. With years of agency experience, Mark understands how emerging technology has changed consumer behavior and marketing operations dramatically. And he has experienced how adapting to this new reality can generate a lot of noise . You can be sure Mark will cut through that noise and plot a path towards success.

Even if you don’t immediately recognize this challenge, Mark de Kock is the perfect person to help you bring vision and structure to your marketing. As no other, he understands that your business needs to add value today, to exist six months from now. With an entrepreneurial spirit and his operational tenure, he is as at home in the C-suite as he is when you see him riding his motorbike. With his uncanny ability to analyze and prioritize, he’ll help you create value above and beyond your current business model and make the team enjoy, support and embrace this new reality.

One warning. Mark is at his best when he can work with like-minded, highly motivated people. Making an impact is what motivates him, so If you’re looking for just another caretaker—someone who will not rock your organization’s boat — Mark may not be the best person to work with. When he’s not plotting a course towards your north star, you might catch him teaching a spinning class at his local gym, helping an old friend with their cupcake business, or find him freely riding on his motorbike in any direction—even when that leads him to his kid’s soccer practice.
