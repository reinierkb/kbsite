If we’d believe something as a 10x developer would exist—which we don’t—, Younes would come very close. When solving a problem, he has the ability to zoom from code-, to user-, to business level and back in a few milliseconds, viewing potential solutions from as many angles as possible. Leading by example, he navigates the sweet spot between setting extremely high standards for the team—elevating both codebase and team practices— and getting actual shit done.  He’s a very approachable person always making the effort to help everyone involved understand the complex matters at hand. Younes is opinionated on technology matters, without being dogmatic, always open for trying out emerging stuff or relying on more proven technology if it helps solving the issue at hand. He fosters a culture of experimentation in his teams, providing a safe space to try out multiple solutions to a problem. That, and the fact that he isn’t too attached to his own ego, allows everyone to contribute. Younes: a dedicated leader with a shitload of experience, what else do you need to know, really.
