David is a 100% bullshit-free leader, committed to make real and lasting success happen.

Once he has that deep understanding, he uses it to elevate your organization instead of hitting you on the head with it.  David loves facilitating through unorthodox means, creating a safe environment for creativity and experimentation. Expect to find yourself acting out a user need. David always makes sure that his team has the positive energy to make magical things happen. Even if it's a hell of a job, he makes it look heavenly easy to accomplish.

### Expertise: 
interim leadership, product management, online/marketing/digital/IT strategy development, facilitation, executive coaching.

### Three things David worked on:
* [Symphony.live](https://symphony.live/), a Netflix-like streaming service for classical music lovers, offering concerts from the global top 10 orchestras to a growing base of fans across the world as a monthly subscription. Client: Symphony Media, David was Head of Product with 2 development teams building the web-, mobile- and TV apps and all the marketing funnels leading into it.
* [Elsevier Health Hubs](https://elsevier.health/en-US/home), a web app bundling evidence-based best practices on how to diagnose, treat and prevent COVID19. This required collecting topical info from multiple internal data silos and representing it intuitively. Later, it evolved into a content marketing hub for multiple topics. David was Product Manager for the project.
* [Buma/Stemra](https://mijn.bumastemra.nl), the collection agency for composers and lyrics writers needed to realign itself to changing user needs and digital communications. David co-led the team that developed a portfolio of solutions to bring the brand, comms and digital channels up to modern standards.

> David is a fantastic captain. The way he navigates digital transformation projects through dangerous waters is off this planet. The rigor, force and expertise he brings in, helped me and many client teams to get the impossible done. He has an exquisite nose for highly talented people that help push any project beyond expectations and results. His critical thinking and pirate attitude make working with David an incredible delight. I would love to be on his team on any project because while it might be challenging, it's gonna be great fun at the same time. Sign me up, skipper.â€”Jonne Kuyt, Director of Design and Innovation Edenspiekermann
